              <h4>Richard Rhodes</h4>
            </div>

            <p>Richard is the founding partner of <b>Rhodes
            Architectural Stone</b> and Design Principal
            of <b><a href="http://www.rhodesworksdesign.com" target="_blank">Rhodesworks Design Studio</a></b>. A nationally
            recognized artist, master mason and scholar,
            Richard has more than 30 years’ experience.
            Uniquely, he has worked across all aspects of
            the stone industry including, design, quarrying,
            fabrication and installation.</p>
            <p>Beginning his masonry career with a formal,
            hands-on apprenticeship in Siena, Italy, Richard
            was the first foreigner initiated into the
            operative branch of the Freemason’s 726-year
            history and is fittingly renowned as the “last
            apprentice” following the collapse of the guild
            in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Richard now spends the majority of his time
            on his design and sculpture practice. Over the
            past 20 years, he has completed several major
            sculpture commissions and, although most
            are privately held, his largest and most public
            sculpture is on permanent display at the newly 
            opened Tacoma Art Museum, designed by
            Antoine Predock Architects.</p>
            <p>A nationally acclaimed lecturer and educator,
            Richard has twice addressed the national
            conventions of the American Institute of
            Architects (AIA) and the Association of
            Professional Landscape Designers. He has also
            delivered a five-lecture educational series to
            the Institute of Classical Architecture in both
            New York and San Francisco, and lectured to the
            Building Stone Institute and many public and
            private universities.</p>
            <p>Richard’s book <i>Stone Expressions: An Exploration
            of Stone Design and Use</i>, is near completion.
            This large-format book contains 250 color
            plates of international historical stonework
            photographed by Richard, who is also an
            accomplished medium-format photographer.
            Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for <i>The
            New Yorker</i> magazine, is writing the
            book’s foreword.</p>
